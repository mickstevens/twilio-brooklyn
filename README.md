Twilio Voice App Control via SMS

Hey, I love Twilio but sometimes forget to change my active Voice URL when I go out etc. I created this App to address this.

By setting your Messaging URL to point to this App you can change your active Voice App by text.

Just change the various "****" to your Twilio account & app sids etc & the entries that look like phone nos to your own.

You can also obviously change the emboldened keywords in the second if/else statement to something more meaningful to you,
and also expand the if/else if you want to use this to perform more than 3 actions.

Anyway, it does what I want it to do, although still room for improvement (storing the Twilio credentials using Flask/config 
for example...). 

Any problems/questions/suggestions, ping me, detail at the top of the file.

Rgds, Mick
